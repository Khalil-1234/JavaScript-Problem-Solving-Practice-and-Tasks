// Add ‘Polo’ as a member of the same array at the end using one of the utility methods
// Add ‘Polo’ as a member of the same array at the beginning of the array using one of the utility methods
// Remove a member of the same array from the end
// Remove a member of the same array from the beginning



let cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW", "Toyoto", "Suzuki","Mercadec"]; 
 console.log(cars.pop());
 console.log(cars.push("Porsche"));
 console.log(cars.shift());
 console.log(cars.unshift("Bogati"));

 //// Best practice is to use const variables for arrays but here i am using let for my convience.




      // NOTE: I am using cars name instead of using to game names as mentioned in assignment but the procedures
      // i am following are correct as taught by instructer.
