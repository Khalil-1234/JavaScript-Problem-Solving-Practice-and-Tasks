// A --- Write a for loop to traverse the array and find if ‘Cricket’ exists in the array. Print ‘Cricket exists’ if 
// it is in the array.
//  Otherwise print ‘Does not exist’

let games=["cricket","baseball","football"];
for (let i = 0; i < games.length; i++) {
    let element = games[0];
    console.log(element);
    
}

// B --- Write a forEach loop and attempt the same problem as above

const person={
    name:"khalil",
    country:"pakistan",
    current:"in islamabad",
    
    
}
document.write(person.current);
document.write(person.name);
document.write(person.country);
